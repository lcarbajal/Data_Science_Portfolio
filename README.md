# Data Science Portfolio

This repo contains the following work samples of my Data Science practice:

1. **US Stock Market Forecasting**: Prototype of a forecasting tool for daily stock prices of companies on the NYSE. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells are implemented and trained with daily data of hundreads of companies.
2. **Predictive Maintenace**: A Machine Learning (ML) model for predicting device failure has been developed using historical telemetry data of a number of devices. Different implementations of Random Forests are used for this example.

For a **work sample of my Computational Physics practice** using High-Performance Computing (parallel) in nuclear fusion research, please visit my [Bitbucket repo](https://bitbucket.org/lcarbajal/prometheus-upgrade/src/master/) which contains the **Open Source fusion code PROMETHEUS++, freely available for the fusion community**.
